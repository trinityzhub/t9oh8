"A picture is worth a thousand words" and the illustration above without question, conveys how China premeditated and carried out an elaborate scheme to infiltrate and harvest U.S. corporate and user data on a massive scale, utilizing America's technology supply chain.

According to extensive interviews with US government officials and corporate sources, Chinese spies infiltrated close to 30 U.S. companies including Apple and Amazon by compromising America’s technology supply chain. China used a tiny chip to infiltrate America’s top companies and the security of the global technology supply chain had been compromised, while consumers and most companies didn’t know. 

According to the illustration Chinese spies carried out this deceptive and elaborate scheme by the following process as illustrated in the picture.

1. A Chinese military unit designed and manufactured microchips as small as a sharpened pencil tip. Some of the chips were built to look like signal conditioning couplers, and they incorporated memory, networking capability, and sufficient processing power for an attack.
2. The microchips were inserted in Chinese factories that supplied Supermicro, an American supplier of servers and one of the world's biggest sellers of server motherboards with locations in the Netherlands and at its Science and Technology Park in Taiwan.
3. The compromised motherboards were built into servers assembled by Supermicro.
4. The sabotaged servers made their way inside data centers operated by dozens of companies.
5. When a server was installed and switched on, the microchip altered the operating system's core so it could accept modifications. The chip could also contact computers controlled by the attackers in search of further instructions and code.

This begs the question, how much personal and corporate data has China harvested since this scheme first began? How much did corporations know about this elaborate scheme, and was this information reported to users impacted and breached? What do users really know about the integrity of personal and corporate data in the cloud or on servers? How much data today is being harvested from the cloud by China in 2022? Does the average U.S. citizen really know?

Could this be the reason why Taiwan is worried about the security of its chip industry? Could this be a subversive reason why China is bent on invading Taiwan to control the chip industry? These are all critical questions that should be considered and weighed because the future security and integrity of the chip industry is in danger of global surveillance by China, not just for the U.S. but the global community and economy at large. Are we beyond the tipping point of damage control?
