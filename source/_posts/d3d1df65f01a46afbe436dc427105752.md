From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

**Cyberwarfare by China** is the aggregate of all combative activities, including [cyberattacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberattack "Cyberattack"), attributed to the organs of the [People's Republic of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China "China") and various related [advanced persistent threat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat "Advanced persistent threat") (APT) groups from the country.

While some details remain unconfirmed, it is understood that China organizes its resources as follows:

- “Specialized military network warfare forces” ([Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters "Simplified Chinese characters"): 军队专业网络战力量) - Military units specialized in network attack and defense.
- "[PLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Liberation_Army "People's Liberation Army")-authorized forces” (授权力量) - network warfare specialists in the [Ministry of State Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_State_Security_\(China\) "Ministry of State Security (China)") (MSS) and the [Ministry of Public Security (MPS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Public_Security_\(China\) "Ministry of Public Security (China)").
- “Non-governmental forces” (民间力量) - civilian and semi-civilian\[*[definition needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")*] groups that spontaneously engage in network attack and defense.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare_by_China#cite_note-time-1)

In response to claims that Chinese universities, businesses, and politicians have been subject to cyber espionage by the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States") [National Security Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency "National Security Agency") since 2009,[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare_by_China#cite_note-2)[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare_by_China#cite_note-3) the PLA announced a cyber security squad in May 2011 to defend their own networks.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare_by_China#cite_note-4)

Since [Xi Jinping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping "Xi Jinping") became [General Secretary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Secretary_of_the_Chinese_Communist_Party "General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party") of the [Chinese Communist Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party "Chinese Communist Party") in 2012, the [Ministry of State Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_State_Security_\(China\) "Ministry of State Security (China)") (MSS) gained more responsibility over [cyberespionage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber_spying "Cyber spying") compared with the [People's Liberation Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Liberation_Army "People's Liberation Army"), and currently oversees various [advanced persistent threats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threats "Advanced persistent threats").[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare_by_China#cite_note-5) According to security researcher Timo Steffens, APTs in China leverage skills from private as well as public institutions and individuals, including smaller companies and hackers that take on government contracts.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare_by_China#cite_note-6)

In 2017, *[Foreign Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Policy "Foreign Policy")* provided an estimated range for China's "[hacker army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber_army "Cyber army")" personnel, anywhere from 50,000 to 100,000 individuals.[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare_by_China#cite_note-7)

Officials in the [Indian government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India "Government of India") believe that attacks on Indian government networks, such as the attack on the Indian [National Security Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Council_\(India\) "National Security Council (India)"), have originated from China. According to the Indian government, Chinese hackers are experts in operating [botnets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botnet "Botnet"), of which were used in these attacks.[\[42\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare_by_China#cite_note-ind-42) Additionally, other instances of Chinese [cyberattacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberattacks "Cyberattacks") against India's cyberspace have been reported in multitude.[\[43\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare_by_China#cite_note-43)[\[44\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare_by_China#cite_note-44)

In April 2021, Japan claimed that the Chinese military ordered cyberattacks on about 200 Japanese companies and research institutes, including [JAXA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAXA "JAXA").[\[45\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare_by_China#cite_note-45) In July 2024, government agencies from eight nations, including Japan's [National Police Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Police_Agency_\(Japan\) "National Police Agency (Japan)"), released a joint advisory on APT40.[\[37\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare_by_China#cite_note-:2-37)[\[38\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare_by_China#cite_note-:3-38)

The United States has accused China of cyberwarfare attacks that targeted the networks of important American military, commercial, research, and industrial organizations. A Congressional advisory group has declared China "the single greatest risk to the security of American technologies"[\[49\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare_by_China#cite_note-iw-49) and "there has been a marked increase in cyber intrusions originating in China and targeting U.S. government and defense-related computer systems".[\[49\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare_by_China#cite_note-iw-49)[\[50\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare_by_China#cite_note-TWP-50)[\[51\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare_by_China#cite_note-pcworld-51)[\[52\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare_by_China#cite_note-:0-52) China's cyberwarfare has expanded from cyber-espionage to "pre-positioning" activity for the sabotage and crippling of critical infrastructure.[\[53\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare_by_China#cite_note-53)

In January 2010, [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google "Google") reported targeted [attacks on its corporate infrastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Aurora "Operation Aurora") originating from China "that resulted in the theft of intellectual property from Google." [Gmail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gmail "Gmail") accounts belonging to two [human rights activists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_activists "Human rights activists") were compromised in an attack on Google's password system.[\[54\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare_by_China#cite_note-54) Chinese hackers also gained access to a [database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database "Database") containing [classified information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information "Classified information") about suspected spies, agents, and terrorists under surveillance by the US government.[\[55\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare_by_China#cite_note-55) American security experts connected the Google attack to various other political and corporate espionage efforts originating from China, which included spying against military, commercial, research, and industrial corporations.[\[52\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare_by_China#cite_note-:0-52) [Obama administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obama_administration "Obama administration") officials called the cyberattacks "an increasingly serious cyber threat to US critical industries."[\[50\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare_by_China#cite_note-TWP-50)

[Diplomatic cables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_diplomatic_cables_release "US diplomatic cables release") highlight US concerns that China is exploiting its access to Microsoft source code to boost its offensive and defensive capabilities.[\[58\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare_by_China#cite_note-58)

A number of private computer security firms have stated that they have growing evidence of cyber-espionage efforts originating from China, including the "[Comment Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLA_Unit_61398 "PLA Unit 61398")".[\[59\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare_by_China#cite_note-59)

China has denied accusations of cyberwarfare,[\[60\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare_by_China#cite_note-bw-60) and has accused [the United States of engaging in cyber-warfare against it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare_in_the_United_States "Cyberwarfare in the United States"), accusations which the United States denies.[\[61\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare_by_China#cite_note-wire-61)[\[62\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare_by_China#cite_note-62)[\[63\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare_by_China#cite_note-63)[\[64\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare_by_China#cite_note-64)[\[65\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare_by_China#cite_note-65)

In 2011, a Chinese state TV program displayed outdated screenshots of a Chinese military institute performing cyber attacks on a US-based dissident entity.[\[66\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare_by_China#cite_note-:4-66) The direct visual evidence from an official Chinese source challenges China's claims that it never engages in overseas hacking for government purposes.[\[66\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare_by_China#cite_note-:4-66)

During March 2013, high-level discussions continued.[\[67\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare_by_China#cite_note-67)

In September 2014, a [Senate Armed Services Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Armed_Services "United States Senate Committee on Armed Services") probe revealed hackers associated with the Chinese government committing various intrusions of computer systems belonging to U.S. airlines, technology companies and other contractors involved with the movement of U.S. troops and military equipment,[\[70\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare_by_China#cite_note-70) and in October 2014, The FBI added that hackers, who they believe to be backed by the Chinese government, have recently launched attacks on U.S. companies.[\[71\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare_by_China#cite_note-71)

In 2015, the [U.S. Office of Personnel Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Office_of_Personnel_Management "United States Office of Personnel Management") (OPM) announced that it had been the target of a [data breach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Personnel_Management_data_breach "Office of Personnel Management data breach") targeting the records of as many as 21.5 million people.[\[72\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare_by_China#cite_note-72) *The Washington Post* reported that the attack came from China, citing unnamed government officials.[\[73\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare_by_China#cite_note-73) [FBI director](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation") [James Comey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Comey "James Comey") explained "it is a very big deal from a national security perspective and a counterintelligence perspective. It's a treasure trove of information about everybody who has worked for, tried to work for, or works for the United States government."[\[74\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare_by_China#cite_note-74)

In October 2018, *[Bloomberg Businessweek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_Businessweek "Bloomberg Businessweek")* published a report, citing unnamed corporate and governmental sources, which claimed that the PLA had forced [Supermicro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermicro "Supermicro")'s Chinese sub-contractors to add microchips with hardware backdoors to its servers. The report claimed that the compromised servers had been sold to U.S. government divisions (including the CIA and Department of Defense) and contractors and at least 30 commercial clients.[\[75\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare_by_China#cite_note-75)

In 2019, a study showed continued attacks on the US Navy and its industrial partners.[\[76\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare_by_China#cite_note-76)

In February 2020, a US federal grand jury charged four members of China's [People's Liberation Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Liberation_Army "People's Liberation Army") (PLA) with the [2017 Equifax hack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equifax#May%E2%80%93July_2017_data_breach "Equifax").[\[77\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare_by_China#cite_note-77) The official account of FBI stated on Twitter that they played a role in "one of the largest thefts of personally identifiable information by state-sponsored hackers ever recorded", involving "145 million Americans".[\[78\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare_by_China#cite_note-78)

The *[Voice of America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_of_America "Voice of America")* reported in April 2020 that "U.S. intelligence agencies concluded the Chinese hackers meddled in both the 2016 and 2018 elections" and said "there have already been signs that China-allied hackers have engaged in so-called "spear-phishing" attacks on American political targets" ahead of the [2020 United States elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_elections "2020 United States elections").[\[79\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare_by_China#cite_note-79)

Comparing the semiconductor industry in China mainland and Taiwan today, Taiwan is the leader in terms of overall competitiveness. On 6 August 2020, *[Wired](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_\(magazine\) "Wired (magazine)")* published a report, stating that "Taiwan has faced existential conflict with China for its entire existence and has been targeted by China's state-sponsored hackers for years. But an investigation by one Taiwanese security firm has revealed just how deeply a single group of Chinese hackers was able to penetrate an industry at the core of the Taiwanese economy, pillaging practically its entire semiconductor industry."[\[96\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare_by_China#cite_note-:5-96)

In China not all of these companies are 'front companies' in the strict sense that they were established by intelligence agencies to hide their involvement. The APT landscape in China is run in a 'whole country' approach, leveraging skills from universities, individual, and private and public sectors. So some of the smaller companies might just be a way for individual hackers to band together and be eligible for government contracts.
